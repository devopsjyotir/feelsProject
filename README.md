#### **Description**

An app that takes your mood and recommends what to eat and watch based on it.
or  An app that assists you in deciding where to live based on your objectives. For example, I likeÂ to be surrounded by a community very interested in soccer, join Crossfit, eat healthier, work for X, and my budget is X.

#### **_Technologies_**

- REACT
- MongoDb
- Express

#### **_Getting Started_**
I can't really choose which app will be better to make with the technologies we have used so far.

A Trello board was used to keep track of development progress and can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/M5zvFoMb/feelsproject)
